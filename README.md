# Tokyo Olympic Azure Data Engineering Project

## Overview
This project is an end-to-end **Azure Data Engineering** solution focused on analyzing data from the **Tokyo Olympics**. It leverages various Azure services to build a scalable data pipeline, transforming raw data into actionable insights.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Integration:**
   - Utilized **Azure Data Factory** to extract and load data into **Azure Data Lake Gen 2** for raw storage.
2. **Data Transformation:**
   - Processed, cleaned, and enriched the data using **Azure Databricks (PySpark)**.
3. **Data Storage:**
   - Stored the transformed data back into **Azure Data Lake Gen 2**.
4. **Analytics & Visualization:**
   - Leveraged **Azure Synapse Analytics** to generate insights and visualize data trends.

## Technologies Used
- **Azure Data Factory** (Data Ingestion & Orchestration)
- **Azure Data Lake Gen 2** (Storage)
- **Azure Databricks (PySpark)** (Data Transformation)
- **Azure Synapse Analytics** (Data Analysis & Visualization)
- **Python, SQL** for data processing
- **Power BI** (Optional for advanced reporting)

## Features
- **End-to-End Data Pipeline:** From raw data ingestion to insightful analytics
- **Big Data Processing:** Scalable and efficient data handling using PySpark
- **Cloud-Based Architecture:** Fully implemented on Azure
- **Actionable Insights:** Analyzed trends in Olympic events, athletes, and countries
